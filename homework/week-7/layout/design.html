            <h2>Design</h2>	
			<p1>- I started with the scatterplot and used the y-as as a legend to show the score of a country on the Happy Planet Index and the matching color in the chloropleth. I deleted 2 country’s of the dataset because they were outliers. The 2 country’s were United States and China. United states had a GDP about 18.56 million dollars and china about 11.39 million dollars. As you can see in the scatterplot is the next biggest GDP 4.38 million dollars of Japan. I used the colors green, yellow, orange and red honestly because they used those colors on the Happy Planet Index site and I thought it was really clear. 
			The green color stands for bright and light and the red color for more problems.<br></p1>
			<p1><br>- Like I said each country in the chloropleth has a color based on their Happy Planet Index score. There is no data of the country’s who are black (except for The United States and China). In my opinion the black color is a little distracting but in the end I thought it was the most clear.<br></p1>
			<p1><br>- The interaction design is very clear. You can select a dot in the scatterplot and it will show the matching country.<br></p1>
			<p1><br>- The overall website design is not very special but it looks like a real site. With the navigation balk you can go back and forth between ‘Home’,  ‘About’, Storytelling’ and ‘Design’.<br></p1>
