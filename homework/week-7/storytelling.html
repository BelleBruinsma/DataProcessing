            <h2>Gross domestic product (GDP)</h2>
            <p1>The gross domestic product (GDP) is one of the primary indicators used to gauge the health of a country's economy. 
            It represents the total dollar value of all goods and services produced over a specific time period; you can think of it as the size of the economy. 
            The calculation of GDP can be done in one of two ways: either by adding up what everyone earned in a year (income approach), or by adding up what everyone spent (expenditure method). 
            Logically, both measures should arrive at roughly the same total. As one can imagine, economic production and growth - what GDP represents - has a large impact on nearly everyone within that economy. 
            For example, when the economy is healthy, you will typically see low unemployment and wage increases as businesses demand labor to meet the growing economy. A significant change in GDP, whether up or down, usually has a significant effect on the stock market. 
            It's not hard to understand why; a bad economy usually means lower profits for companies, which in turn means lower stock prices. 
            Investors really worry about negative GDP growth, which is one of the factors economists use to determine whether an economy is in a recession.</p1>

            <h2>Happy Planet Index (HPI)</h2>
            <p1>The Happy Planet Index measures what matters: sustainable wellbeing for all. It tells us how well nations are doing at achieving long, happy, sustainable lives.
			Wealthy Western countries, often seen as the standard of success, do not rank highly on the Happy Planet Index.  
			Instead, several countries in Latin America and the Asia Pacific region lead the way by achieving high life expectancy and wellbeing with much smaller Ecological Footprints.
			The Happy Planet Index provides a compass to guide nations, and shows that it is possible to live good lives without costing the Earth.</p1>

        	<h2>So can we buy happiness?</h2>
            <p1>This is not true as shown it the scatterplot. Overall, people with more money are generally happier than people with less money. But research has shown that this relationship is weaker than many people assume – they seem to think that twice as much money will make them twice as happy, and this just isn’t the case.  
            Not only that, but research by professor and author Kathleen Vohs and her colleagues reveals that merely thinking about money can make people more focused on their own needs and less interested in helping others, which ultimately is a bad recipe for happiness.</p1>
